#### Describe your findings and their conclusions from your analysis.

#### Q1: The decline in marriage rates.
The article mentions declining marriage rates have reduced average male earnings, but increased average female earnings, reflecting the facts that single men tend to work less than married men, while the reverse is true for women. Declining marriage rates also account, mechanically, for much slower growth in earnings per household relative to earnings per capita.

As women have gained more rights and a higher social standing in recent years, they have become more independent. One way this independence has manifested has been working more and getting married later. As shown in our data, [INSERT FIGURE FOR LABOR PERCENTAGE] the percentage of women in the workforce in both Australia and Canada is increasing. This is showing that with better societal standing, women are choosing to work more. One potential cause of this could be that it has become more accessible for people to create their own startup companies. The cost of startups has decreased recently, becoming very popular with the internet [Startup]. This could be a cause of more women joining the workforce since they can work jobs they want.

All of these factors could be causes of declining marriage rates. As women are working more and contributing less to the household, they are focusing on their own professional careers instead of marrying. These findings may be relevant to more of the world as society progresses, but based on our analysis we can only conclude this for the case of Canada and Australia, although it is most likely true for most developed, western countries.

#### Q2: The narrowing gender wage gap
The article attributes the narrowing wage gap to labor demand shifts that favored women over men, as well as a decline in discrimination in the workplace over time.

The gender wage gap has always been a heated topic of debate. Recently, the gap has shrunk due to a multitude of factors. One major influence on this shrinking has been the amount of education women are receiving. Based on the data we have, in both Australia and Canada, the amount of women that are completing post-secondary school is increasing overall [EDUCATION DATA]. This is making the playing field more even for women since they are getting more education and are just as qualified as men. Additionally, the percentage of women that are wage and salaried workers is increasing too [WAGE AND SALARY]. This means that there is an increasing percentage of women that get paid either hourly or with a salary, and not based on their sales (e.g. realtor or car salesman). As a result, women have a steadier income and can argue for equal pay since it is not based on performance. One last factor that we investigated was employment in industry. As more women are hired, they gain footing to argue for better wages and have more influence over their employers [INDUSTRY]. Recently, there has been a decline of women in industry but this may have less to do with wages and more to do with automation and robots replacing industry jobs, especially in developed countries such as Canada and Australia. Overall, the narrowing wage gap can be at least partially attributed to an increase in education, employment, and a change to wage and salary employment.

#### Q3: The preference (or cultural) shift towards market work
The article highlights the shifting cultural norms for women at home and in the labor force as the key impact on the market preference for female work.

As society has been advancing recently, women have begun to work more. This shift towards market work is well documented in the data that we have graphed and are analyzing. The total percentage of women in the labor force is the best indicator of this trend. As seen by the graphs for both Canada and Australia, [TOTAL LABOR] the percentage of women in the labor force has been steadily increasing, showing a shift from housework to market work. To back this up, we also analyzed the labor force participation rate for women. [LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION] This shows that the general trend, despite being somewhat erratic, has been increasing since the 1970s. Our final variable that we analyzed was the percentage of women employers. This was one that went against the rest of our data. In Canada, it increased until 2000, and has since been declining. In Australia, it was very random until 2001 when it peaked, and has also been decreasing since then. [EMPLOYER GRAPHS] This is interesting since as there have been more women working, one would assume that there would have been an increase in women employers as well.

#### Q4: The change in womenâ€™s bargaining power within the household.
The article states that bargaining power within a household originates from whoever works the most hours and earns the highest wages.
  As more women join the workforce, the unemployment rate decreasing for females and their wages increase over time. It closes the gap of bargaining power in the household.






### Reflection

One of the key differences between the last two labs has been how we analyze the data. For psych, there was much less numeric data due to using surveys. Graphing was not as prevalent with less data and data that was based on a 7 point scale. Due to this, we relied more on our interpretations of the questions and responses rather than raw data. As Dr. Eckstein mentioned in her talk, we had to take social aspects into account for our analysis in the psych lab, which made us think more in depth about the rational behind questions and the responses.

In this lab, however, we were able to find much more numeric data thanks to economics being heavily involved in numbers and graphs to see trends. By having more varied data, we were able to see trends more easily and in doing so, we were able to analyze the data quicker. Given the data we had, we quickly noticed a point that Professor Onyeiwu mentioned, which was that the data had no shelf life (it was always relevant) but it was hard to find. The excel sheet we used had many gaps in the data that we had to adjust for, mainly by finding other relevant data that actually had a usable amount of data.

Even with these differences, there were also similarities. We used similar graphing and tests (p-values) in order to transform the raw data into useful information that was easy to be interpreted. We also used similar rationals for trying to understand the social aspects of both the psychology lab and the economics lab since they both had trends that were influenced by society. Seeing as economics and psychology are both social sciences, it makes sense that they have similarities, yet subtle differences.
