#### Q1: The decline in marriage rates.
The article mentions declining marriage rates have reduced average male earnings, but increased average female earnings,reflecting the facts that single men tend to work less than married men, while the reverse is true for women. Declining marriage rates also account, mechanically, for much slower growth in earnings per household relative to earnings per capita.

#### Q2: The narrowing gender wage gap
The article attributes the narrowing wage gap to labor demand shifts that favored women over men, as well as a decline in discrimination in the workplace over time.

#### Q3: The preference (or cultural) shift towards market work
The article highlights the shifting cultural norms for women at home and in the labor force as the key impact on the market preference for female work.

#### Q4: The change in womenâ€™s bargaining power within the household.
The article states that bargaining power within a household originates from whoever works the most hours and earns the highest wages.
