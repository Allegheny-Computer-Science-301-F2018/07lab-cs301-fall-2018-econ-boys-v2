#### Describe your findings and their conclusions from your analysis.

#### Q1: The decline in marriage rates.
The article mentions declining marriage rates have reduced average male earnings, but increased average female earnings,reflecting the facts that single men tend to work less than married men, while the reverse is true for women. Declining marriage rates also account, mechanically, for much slower growth in earnings per household relative to earnings per capita.

#### Q2: The narrowing gender wage gap
The article attributes the narrowing wage gap to labor demand shifts that favored women over men, as well as a decline in discrimination in the workplace over time.

#### Q3: The preference (or cultural) shift towards market work
The article highlights the shifting cultural norms for women at home and in the labor force as the key impact on the market preference for female work.

#### Q4: The change in womenâ€™s bargaining power within the household.
The article states that bargaining power within a household originates from whoever works the most hours and earns the highest wages.





### Reflection

One of the key differences between the last two labs has been how we analyze the data. For psych, there was much less numeric data due to using surveys. Graphing was not as prevalent with less data and data that was based on a 7 point scale. Due to this, we relied more on our interpretations of the questions and responses rather than raw data. As Dr. Eckstein mentioned in her talk, we had to take social aspects into account for our analysis in the psych lab, which made us think more in depth about the rational behind questions and the responses.

In this lab, however, we were able to find much more numeric data thanks to economics being heavily involved in numbers and graphs to see trends. By having more varied data, we were able to see trends more easily and in doing so, we were able to analyze the data quicker. Given the data we had, we quickly noticed a point that Professor Onyeiwu mentioned, which was that the data had no shelf life (it was always relevant) but it was hard to find. The excel sheet we used had many gaps in the data that we had to adjust for, mainly by finding other relevant data that actually had a usable amount of data.

Even with these differences, there were also similarities. We used similar graphing and tests (p-values) in order to transform the raw data into useful information that was easy to be interpreted. We also used similar rationals for trying to understand the social aspects of both the psychology lab and the economics lab since they both had trends that were influenced by society. Seeing as economics and psychology are both social sciences, it makes sense that they have similarities, yet subtle differences.
